[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/lanl/spiner.svg?token=1Son5aqoY35CxrTszRiD&branch=main)](https://www.travis-ci.com/lanl/spiner)

Performance portable utilities for representing and interpolating
tabulated data. Named for [Brent
Spiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Spiner).

## Installation

`Spiner` is self-contained. Simply clone it as
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.lanl.gov:jonahm/spiner.git
```
If you want to use unit tests, clone with submodules to include `Catch2`.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@gitlab.lanl.gov:jonahm/spiner.git
```
To build and run unit tests,
```bash
cd test
make test
```
and to do convergence testing,
```bash
cd test
make convergence
```
At the moment, `Spiner` cannot be installed into a system directory.

**Note that you may have to edit the `Makefile` to set paths to, e.g., `hdf5`.**

## Dependencies

`Spiner` has no dependencies for the `databox` tool. Simply include it in your project. It is header-only and requires only a few files:

- `databox.hpp`
- `interpolation.hpp`
- `spiner_types.hpp`
- `sp5.hpp`

The testing tooling requires a few different pieces:

- Unit testing requires [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2),
  which is header only. This is included via a git submodule.
- Convergence testing requires the scientific python stack, including:
  - python3
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

## HDF5

`Spiner` supports reading and writing DataBox objects into a custom HDF5 format called `SP5`. 
To enable this, compile with the appropriate `HDF5` linking and the flag `-DSPINER_USE_HDF5`.

## Features

- Spiner supports interpolation in arbitrary dimensions, and it's fast in 3d and fewer.
- Spiner supports interpolation onto "subtables"

## Interpolation

Interpolation is linear. Here's an example of interpolation in 3D (2D
slice shown). Convergence is second-order, as expected.
